Code of conduct must always be followed when contributing to the product.

Code of Conduct
Pledge
As members of a team, we pledge to be respectful of other members, make sure that everyone feels welcomed and heard, and to treat every member as a fellow human being regardless of age, religion, race, sexuality, sexual orientation, or any other difference between us.

Standards
To create an open and healthy work and learning space we will make sure to:
•	Not use negative language or actions
•	Ensure that every member has a say in any actions the group takes
•	Listen to all criticisms fairly and impartially
•	Be understanding and empathetic of other members of the team
•	Help members if they struggle, regardless of if it is “not my work” or not
As part of this we will not:
•	Harass or disparage members of the team, or anyone else
•	Use unwanted sexual language, images, attention, or advances
•	Give or publish private information of a team member with explicit permission
These standards are not exhaustive, and every team member should exercise fair judgement and caution when interacting with other members.

Responsibilities 
Each team member is responsible for making clear and clarifying how they wish to interact with and be treated by other members. Each team member is expected to speak up should they feel something is wrong or somebody is being mistreated. The team will be expected to act as a group should any problems make themselves known. Every member has the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not meet the code of conduct, the team’s standards, or are otherwise problematic

 
Scope 
The code of conduct applies whenever and however team members may interact, and when any member may be representing the team, such as a project demonstration.

Enforcement
If a team member feels that they have experienced unacceptable behaviour, they should contact the course supervisor and make their issues known so that they can be solved.
Any team member who engages in unacceptable behaviour may be removed from the group
